## 💬 About Me

I'm a fullstack developer with **6+ years** of experience building robust web applications and APIs. I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions, especially when it involves **microservices**, **AI integration**, or **scalable SaaS architectures**.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or working on side projects that solve real-world problems. I'm passionate about clean code, performance optimization, and mentoring fellow developers.

**Currently:** Building AI-powered solutions and contributing to the Laravel ecosystem.
